        As I now embark on this endeavor; I can't help but feel excited!
        I can now share my thoughts with the world, program and code to my hearts
        content, and strive to take on greater and more meaningful challenges.

        Although at this moment my website still requires much work to be done,
        I welcome the challenge. The only thought that crosses my mind though is
        how many cups of <b>Java</b> it will take. - (PS. This is a programmer's blog)

        and one website but that's not the point.
