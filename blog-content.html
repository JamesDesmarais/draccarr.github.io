        <h2>C# Interfaces: - Mar 13, 2019</h2>
    </div>
    <p>
            Ah interfaces, how I love thee, let me count the ways. You provide a template to generate
            common method and properties for classes; I can use Polymorphism to store collections of 
            different classes that implement you; I could use you like a tagging system; 
            I can even have as many of you as I want!
    </p>
    <p>
            The only thing that turns me off about them is C#'s implementation syntax: 
            <b>class SomeClassName: SomeParentClassName, ISomeInterfaceName</b>
            For you see, the only way you can distinguish the difference between the interfaces and the 
            inherited class (if there is one) is by seeing the capital 'I' in front of the interface's name. In Java however, you would use
            the key work 'implements' after the class name.

        <h2>Chapter I: Trapped: - Mar 8, 2019</h2>
    </div>
    <p>The other night, one of the role-playing groups on my server got stood up by their game's story teller.
        Although this was tragic, it left me with an excellent opportunity to practice my improv skills.</p>
    <p>It was late into the winter’s night, two people are lying unconscious in a cage. One of them slowly rises
        from the ground, shaking his head to rid it of the snow. Still groggy, he attempts to stand only to bang
        his head on the 1-inch thick steel bars.</p>
    <p>"Ouch!"</p>
    <p>"I didn't do it!" The other man quickly sits up. "Wait... Why are we in a cage?"</p>
    <p>"Look, there's a light coming from the north."</p>
    <p>"I feel ignored... So what? It doesn’t matter if we can't get out of here."</p>
    <p>"Don't tell me this is one of those, you have no chance of escaping, types of cages. There has to
        be a door somewhere." He looks around. "See, right behind you; there it is."</p>
    <p>"Blimey, your right! It looks rusted too so I bet I could get this open no problem." He then strikes the door
        with the heel of his boot. A loud clang emerges into the forest.</p>
    <p>"Try kicking at the same time?"</p>
    <p>The man nods. Together with great force, they plow their heels into the edge of the door
        and the lock pops off. They then proceed to slap each other’s hands in the air. Soon after, they notice five
        sets of
        yellow glowing eyes emanating from the darkness of the night to the east, an intensifying growling noise can be
        heard.</p>
    <p>"Maybe we were supposed to stay IN the cage." <b>- (To be continued...)</b></p>

        <h2>A journey begins: - Mar 7, 2019</h2>
    </div>
    <p>
        As I now embark on this endeavor; I can't help but feel excited!
        I can now share my thoughts with the world, program and code to my hearts
        content, and strive to take on greater and more meaningful challenges.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although at this moment my website still requires much work to be done,
        I welcome the challenge. The only thought that crosses my mind though is
        how many cups of <b>Java</b> it will take. <b>- (PS. This is a programmer's blog)</b>

        Today I made a webpage! Well, technically I made a few webpages
        and one website but that's not the point.
