        "Get off him!"
        Bullivar thrusts the torch into the demon wolf's mouth in an attempt to free Viper’s leg.
        The wolf bites down hard on Bullivar's hand, mashing it with its teeth. To Bullivar's 
        surprise, his hand comes off. It was not for Naught though, as the wolf begins choking on the
        relinquished torch.
    </p>
    <p>
        Viper: "Ha, serves your right! It's payback time!" Viper kicks the wolf hard in the throat with 
        his good leg. The wolf gasps for air, the light from its eyes fades away and then it stops moving.
    </p>
    <p>
        The hunters have managed to ward off the rest of the wolves and are currently approaching 
        the cage. "Hey! You two okay in there!? Ragnar, grab the ointment! Flair, help me carry this one."
        "Thanks for the rescue... poor things were probably just hungry... either way... thanks." Bullivar explains to one of the hunters.
        Bullivar looks at the hunter with a straight face. The hunter tilts his head "..." after a few more seconds of that, the hunter breaks
        the silence. "You do know it just ate your hand; right?"  
    </p>
    <p>
        The female hunter speaks to Viper while helping her companion lift him up. "I'm Flair. The one fetching the ointment is Ragnar, and this
        is Bannen, our glorious leader. We, are hunters."

    <p>
        Hell no. Am I really going to get eaten by this; this demon wolf?
        Normally this would be the point where my life flashes before
        my eyes but things are looking pretty blank. This SUCKS! I 
        absolutely refuse to die here! "Listen here wolfy, I'm not gonna 
        beg for mercy, nor am I gonna roll over and die! Now, say hello
        to Pointy!"
    </p>
    <p>
        The wolf catches the spear with its teeth. Now, looking like
        death itself. Its pupils divide and the last bit of white in 
        its eyes turn crimson. Pointy snaps under the pressure
        exerted from the beast's jaws. However, Pointy is not the
        only victim of snapping today.
    </p>
    <p>
        AHHHHH! Get this thing off my leg! "... Right..." Viper responds
        with a shuddering tone. "Get off him beast!" Viper then jabs 
        both torches into the wolf's eyes, only causing the wolf to 
        clamp down harder on Bullivar's leg. Unlike the others, this one
        seems to be significantly less flammable.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the background, three wolves fall to the ground. Each with a
        crossbow bolt protruding from their head. Looking along 
        the trajectory of the bolts, three silhouettes can be seen holding, 
        you guessed it, crossbows. The wolves charge at the hunters.

    <p>
        I stab at the beast, Pointy sinking deep into the wolf’s furry flesh.
        That should teach em to keep their space heh. Sure, it's kinda
        cruel to kill these things when they're probably just hungry.
        But hey, it's not my fault I'm soo delicious. "Hey Viper, how's your side
        holden uuuuuu...." My jaw drops as I discover the two large lumps of charred;
        flaming wolf.
    </p>
    <p>
        "'Firely' productive, I would say hahaha. Apparently, wolves are VERY flammable."
    </p>
    <p>"Right..." Back to jabbing then. Now, more determined than ever to not be
        bested by the likes of that pyro; I channel my strength, take a deep breath,
        and let loose. I rapidly ram Pointy prominently into a wolf near the entrance;
        brutally perforating it.
    </p>
    <p>
        "Hey, calm down there!"
    </p>
    <p>
        I let out a loud cry, succumbing to my blood lust. Wolf after wolf
        fall to my spear. Tuffs of fur fly, the once penetrating growls now
        being muffled by the sounds of whimpers.
    </p>
    <p>
        "Umm... Bullivar. BULLIVAR!" I am being shaken. My senses return.
        "What?" "We appear to have a visitor." I look towards the now fully
        open cage entrance. I... I didn't know they could get that big. This
        thing is twice the size of the others. Apparently, nature thought
        it wasn’t intimidating enough so it decided to give it black fur, red
        eyes, and a bark that could that could kill. Nature was wrong. I hate
        nature.

    <p>
        Bullivar takes a quick glance at the tree
        "That's a lotta nope. Cage, definitely the cage. Abandon
        this pointy object I shall not!"
    </p>
    <p>
        With great haste, Bullivar sprints towards the cage.
        Over the racing of his heart and the panting
        of deep breaths. The snapping of anxious jaws can
        can be heard. One wolf seems to be faster than the
        others as the heat of its breath is now warming the
        back of Bullivar's leg. Soo close that the tips of his leg
        hairs are getting plucked with each snap of the beast's
        jaws.
    </p>
    <p>
        Enraged by Bullivar's surprising speed, the wolf unleashes
        its last reserves of energy, exerting all that it can into one
        final bone crushing bite. (SNAP!) The wolf wiffs on the bite
        and accidently put its face in the path of the backend of
        Bullivar's boot, knocking it to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
        Bullivar manages to reach the cage. "I have the torches!
        Get inside before you become dog food!" Viper yells
        directly into Bullivar's ear and then shuts the door.
    </p>
    <p>
        Slowly, the other wolves begin surrounding the cage.
        There is soo much growling, they can feel the reverberations
        through the metal bars. Two wolves begin bashing their
        sides against the cage causing it to wobble back and forth.
    </p>
    <p>
        "I count about twelve in all, think we can take em?" Viper inquires.
        "Hope so, I did not risk my life for my best friend for nothing."
        "Aww, thank you." "Not you! Pointy." Bullivar makes a glancing
        gesture towards the spear.
        "Oh... I see..."
    </p>
    <p>
        The cage wobbling intensifies as a third wolf joins the party.
        Now without its lock, the cages entrance subtly widens
        as the door slowly begins to open. Unfortunately,
        the cage dwellers do not notice the transition.

    <p>
        "SEE, this is why you don't rattle cages in strange locations. Dogs," Bullivar says.
    </p>
    <p>
        "Perhaps we can break some bars off this cage to use as weapons," Viper suggests.
    </p>
    <p>
        "You could try, but that would be INCREDIBLY difficult to do soo... perhaps we should try not doing that."
    </p>
    <p>
        Bullivar and Viper begin to scan the area outside the cage. They notice two lit torches hanging on a nearby tree.
        Deeper into the forest, Viper can make out the shape of what he thinks may either be a long sharp tree branch or
        a spear. "The torches are clearly the safer bet." He thinks to himself. "But if I can get that spear or long branch,
        I could
        run back to the cage for shelter and poke at the enemies through the bars. The only problem is that I would have
        to get closer to the scary growling noises..."
    </p>
    <p>
        "Bullivar, I'm heading for the spear. Wish me luck," he says as he takes off in the direction of the pointy looking
        silhouette.
    </p>
    <p>
        "Got it, I'll grab the torches!"
    </p>
    <p>
        "Yes!" Bullivar thinks to himself whilst doing a fist pump as he approaches the dark object. "Yep definitely a
        spear."
    </p>
    <p>
        As Viper grabs the spear, he sees two new glowing eyes appear from the forest. Closer
        however, he sees the face a wolf about five meters away from him. It is bearing its teeth and crinkling its nose.
        It looks pretty angry.
    </p>
    <p>
        "What do I do? Should I run back, stand my ground here, attempt to climb the nearby tree?
        If I can make it back to the cage in time, I'm sure I can fend these beasts off. If I stand my ground here
        I'm pretty screwed because I will get surrounded. If I climb the tree, I'll have to abandon the spear, but I think I
        could out wait them if I do. There is a chance I could freeze out here though, I need to get some place warm."

        <h2>C# Interfaces: - Mar 13, 2019</h2>
    </div>
    <p>
            Ah interfaces, how I love thee, let me count the ways. You provide a template to generate
            common method and properties for classes; I can use Polymorphism to store collections of 
            different classes that implement you; I could use you like a tagging system; 
            I can even have as many of you as I want!
    </p>
    <p>
            The only thing that turns me off about them is C#'s implementation syntax: 
            <b><i>class SomeClassName: SomeParentClassName, ISomeInterfaceName</i></b>
            For you see, the only way you can distinguish the difference between the interfaces and the 
            inherited class (if there is one) is by seeing the capital 'I' in front of the interface's name. In Java however, you would use
            the key work 'implements' after the class name.

    <p>The other night, one of the role-playing groups on my server got stood up by their game's story teller.
        Although this was tragic, it left me with an excellent opportunity to practice my improv skills.</p>
    <p>It was late into the winter’s night, two people are lying unconscious in a cage. One of them slowly rises
        from the ground, shaking his head to rid it of the snow. Still groggy, he attempts to stand only to bang
        his head on the 1-inch thick steel bars.</p>
    <p>"Ouch!"</p>
    <p>"I didn't do it!" The other man quickly sits up. "Wait... Why are we in a cage?"</p>
    <p>"Look, there's a light coming from the north."</p>
    <p>"I feel ignored... So what? It doesn’t matter if we can't get out of here."</p>
    <p>"Don't tell me this is one of those, you have no chance of escaping, types of cages. There has to
        be a door somewhere." He looks around. "See, right behind you; there it is."</p>
    <p>"Blimey, your right! It looks rusted too so I bet I could get this open no problem." He then strikes the door
        with the heel of his boot. A loud clang emerges into the forest.</p>
    <p>"Try kicking at the same time?"</p>
    <p>The man nods. Together with great force, they plow their heels into the edge of the door
        and the lock pops off. They then proceed to slap each other’s hands in the air. Soon after, they notice five
        sets of
        yellow glowing eyes emanating from the darkness of the night to the east, an intensifying growling noise can be
        heard.</p>
    <p>"Maybe we were supposed to stay IN the cage." <b><i>- (To be continued...)</i></b></p>

        I can now share my thoughts with the world, program and code to my hearts
